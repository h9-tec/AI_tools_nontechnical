## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes to Avoid

### The Top 10 Mistakes (And How to Fix Them)

#### 1. Being Too Vague
**‚ùå Wrong:** "Help me with marketing"

**‚úÖ Right:** "Create a 3-month social media marketing plan for a local coffee shop targeting millennials, with a $500 monthly budget, focusing on Instagram and TikTok"

**Fix:** Always include:
- Specific context
- Clear objectives
- Defined constraints
- Target audience
- Desired format

#### 2. Not Iterating
**‚ùå Wrong:** Accept first response and move on

**‚úÖ Right:** 
```
Initial: "Write a cover letter"
Refine: "Make it more enthusiastic"
Refine: "Add specific achievements"
Refine: "Shorten to 250 words"
Final: Perfect output
```

#### 3. Information Overload
**‚ùå Wrong:** One giant prompt with 10 different requests

**‚úÖ Right:** Break into steps:
```
Step 1: "Research the topic"
Step 2: "Create an outline"
Step 3: "Write the introduction"
Step 4: "Develop main points"
Step 5: "Write conclusion"
```

#### 4. Ignoring Hallucinations
**‚ùå Wrong:** Trust all AI facts blindly

**‚úÖ Right:** 
- Verify statistics
- Check dates
- Confirm names
- Validate links
- Cross-reference important facts

#### 5. Wrong Tool Selection
**‚ùå Wrong:** Using ChatGPT for everything

**‚úÖ Right:**
- Current events ‚Üí Perplexity or Bing
- Long analysis ‚Üí Claude
- Google tasks ‚Üí Gemini
- Images ‚Üí Bing Creator
- Research ‚Üí Perplexity

#### 6. No Context Provided
**‚ùå Wrong:** "Write an email"

**‚úÖ Right:** "Write a formal email to my manager requesting remote work Fridays. Context: I've been with the company 2 years, strong performance reviews, 1-hour commute. Tone: Professional but friendly. Length: 150-200 words."

#### 7. Forgetting Personas
**‚ùå Wrong:** Generic responses

**‚úÖ Right:** "As a senior HR manager with 15 years experience in tech companies, explain why work-life balance matters for retention"

#### 8. Single Model Dependency
**‚ùå Wrong:** Only using one AI tool

**‚úÖ Right:** Test same prompt across 3 tools:
- ChatGPT for creative
- Claude for analytical
- Gemini for factual

#### 9. Privacy Violations
**‚ùå NEVER Input:**
- Passwords
- Credit card info
- SSN/Personal IDs
- Confidential work data
- Medical records
- Private conversations

**‚úÖ Safe Practice:**
- Use generic examples
- Redact sensitive info
- Create fictional scenarios
- Use placeholder data

#### 10. Expecting Perfection
**‚ùå Wrong:** AI will do everything perfectly

**‚úÖ Right:** AI is your assistant, not replacement:
- AI drafts, you edit
- AI suggests, you decide
- AI analyzes, you verify
- AI creates, you refine
